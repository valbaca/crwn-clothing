# crwn-clothing üëë ‚öõÔ∏è

crwn-clothing is a hip shopping page for my development portfolio. It's built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [Reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect), and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). The site is integrated with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for persistence and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for payments.
